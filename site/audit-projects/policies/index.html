<p>When you submit a classified ad for publication on the Site, you agree that the advertisement as it appears on the Site becomes our property and you assign all ownership interest in the advertisement as it appears on the Site under copyright law or otherwise to us.

We will accept only standard abbreviations and require proper punctuation. We reserve the right to edit, reclassify, revise, reject or cancel any advertisement at any time, in our sole discretion. Rates and specifications for any advertisement are subject to change.</p>
<h2 id="real-estate-advertisements-equal-housing-opportunity">Real Estate Advertisements; Equal Housing Opportunity</h2>
<p>The Federal Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to advertise "any preference, limitation, or discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin, or intention to make any such preference, limitation, or discrimination." State law may also forbid discrimination based on these factors and others. We will not knowingly accept any advertising for real estate which is in violation of the law. All persons are hereby informed that all dwellings advertised are available on an equal opportunity basis. To complain of discrimination call the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development at 800-669-9777.</p>
<h2 id="job-listings">Job Listings</h2>
<p>Our Site may permit users to post, and search for, job openings. We do not knowingly accept listings regarding employment that are not for bona fide job opportunities.

If you think that a listing posted on our Site discriminates on any illegal basis, or is otherwise illegal, please contact us. We encourage you to investigate fully and understand all aspects of any job you are considering.</p>
