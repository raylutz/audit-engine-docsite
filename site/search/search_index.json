This does not mean that all examples of that category of Personal Information were in fact \"sold\" but reflects our good faith belief to the best of our knowledge that some of that information may have been shared for value in return. We will update this disclosure from time to time as appropriate.</p> <p>In response to a verified consumer request for categories of Personal Information \"sold,\" we will investigate and provide an individualized response to the consumer, and will not merely refer the consumer to our general practices outlined in this Privacy Policy unless our response would be the same for all consumers and this Privacy Policy discloses all the information that is otherwise required for the response to such a consumer request.</p> <p>Category</p> <ol> <li>Identifiers.</li> <li>Personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute.</li> <li>Protected classification characteristics under California or federal law.</li> <li>Commercial information.</li> <li>Internet or other similar network activity.</li> <li>Geolocation data.</li> <li>Sensory data.</li> <li>Professional or employment-related information.</li> <li>Non-public education information.</li> <li>Inferences drawn from other personal information.</li> </ol> <p>Use of Personal Information for Business Purposes or Commercial Purposes.</p> <p>We may use or disclose Personal Information we collect for \"business purposes\" or \"commercial purposes\" (as defined under the CCPA), which may include the following examples.

We will not merely refer the consumer to our general practices outlined in this Privacy Policy unless our response would be the same for all consumers and this Privacy Policy discloses all the information that is otherwise required for the response to such a consumer request.</p> <p>Disclosing Personal Information to Other Parties</p> <p>We may disclose your Personal Information to the following categories of other parties for a business purpose or commercial purpose, as those terms are defined in the CCPA:</p> <ul> <li>Our affiliates</li> <li>Service providers: such as contractors, agents or sponsors who help us manage or provide our products and services by, for example: developing or supporting products and features; sending email messages on our behalf; processing payments; fulfilling orders; delivering subscriptions; auditing; processing data or statistics; and serving, customizing or delivering marketing.

If you would like to opt out from this use, or for more information, please see our Cookie Policy which includes links to specific third party opt-outs.</p> <p>Your CCPA Privacy Rights and Choices</p> <p>California residents may have certain rights under the CCPA, many of which are subject to limitations or exceptions under applicable law:</p> <p>(a) Right to Know about Personal Information Collected or \"Sold\"</p> <p>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your Personal Information over the past 12 months. After we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you within the time required by the CCPA, the relevant information, which may include:</p> <ul> <li>The categories of Personal Information we collected about you.</li> <li>The categories of sources for the Personal Information we collected about you.</li> <li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that Personal Information.</li> <li>The categories of third parties with whom we share that Personal Information.</li> <li>The specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).</li> <li> <p>If we sold your Personal Information, or disclosed your Personal Information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing:</p> </li> <li> <p>sales, identifying the Personal Information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and</p> </li> <li>disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the Personal Information categories that each category of recipient obtained.</li> </ul> <p>(b) Right to Request Deletion of Personal Information</p> <p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions, including if we need the Personal Information for a reason related to our business, such as:</p> <ol> <li>providing goods or Services to you;</li> <li>detecting and resolving issues related to security or functionality;</li> <li>complying with legal obligations;</li> <li>conducting research in the public interest;</li> <li>exercising free speech or ensuring another\u2019s exercise of free speech; or</li> <li>using the information for internal purposes that a consumer might reasonably expect.</li> </ol> <p>After we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete your Personal Information from our records in the time and manner required by the CCPA, subject to any limitations or exceptions under law.</p> <p>Exercising Your Rights</p> <p>To exercise the rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us through the web form link provided below in Contact Us.</p> <p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.</p> <p>The verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative. This means that in making a request you may be required to: provide your email and phone number, customer information, and/or account sign-up authentication or other information needed to verify your identity depending on the sensitivity of the Personal Information that is the subject of the request.</p> <p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you. If we are unable to verify your identity, we reserve the right to deny the request. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor\u2019s identity or authority to make the request.</p> <p>If you choose to use an authorized agent to submit a request to know or a request to delete your information, we may require that you: (1) provide the authorized agent written permission to do so; and (2) verify your own identity directly with us. We will not require these steps if we have received proof that you have provided the authorized agent with a power of attorney pursuant to California Probate Code sections 4000 to 4465. We may deny a request from an agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf. We may also deny a request from an agent that does not meet the requirements for authorized agents under the CCPA.</p> <p>Once we have verified your identity (and your authorized agent, as applicable), we will respond to your request as appropriate. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request. If we are unable to complete your request in whole or in part, we will let you know why.</p> <p>Response Timing and Format</p> <p>We use good faith efforts to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days after its receipt. If we need more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and the needed extension period in writing.</p> <p>If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by email.</p> <p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request\u2019s receipt. If we cannot comply with any portion of a request, the response we provide will also explain why, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a commercially reasonable format to provide your Personal Information that is commonly useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, but we do not guarantee that all formats are useable in all media. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p> <p>Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of CCPA Privacy Rights</p> <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. In particular, we will not:</p> <ul> <li>Deny you goods or services</li> <li>Charge you different prices for goods or services, whether through denying benefits or imposing penalties</li> <li>Provide you with a different level or quality of goods or services</li> <li>Threaten you with any of the above</li> </ul> <p>Financial Incentives</p> <p>We may offer you certain financial incentives for the collection of your Personal Information and as permitted by the CCPA. These incentives may result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your Personal Information\u2019s value and contain written terms that describe the program\u2019s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time. Details of the incentive, if applicable, including how to opt in or out and the basis for the value of the incentive, will be provided prior to or at the time of your participation.</p>"},{"location":"about/privacy/#california-do-not-track-disclosures","title":"California Do Not Track Disclosures","text":"<p>We do not currently respond to browser Do Not Track signals or other browser or device based mechanisms that provide a method to opt out of the collection of information across the networks of websites and online services in which we participate.

AuditEngine compares this independent tabulation ballot-by-ballot with the results of the voting system to find those exact ballots where we differ. Our system works best if we audit all contests because it gives us the most information about the marking habits of each voter so we can tell the difference between a true mark versus a \"hesitation mark\" or crease in the ballot.</p> <p>AuditEngine runs in the cloud, where we can harness the power of large data centers.

Each stage takes inputs and produces outputs, and once the data is created by that stage, it is not altered later. A later stage can run as soon as data produced by an earlier stage is created. This structure is best for an auditing platform because we can check and \"prove\" the validity of each stage output based on the set of inputs. Each set of data is tracked using cryptographic hash values to detect if the data has been changed from when it was originally built.</p> <p>The stages involved in any given audit will vary depending on the data provided, the type of audit, the workflow methodology, voting system vendor, reports required, and other considerations. There are also a number of tools available that operate outside the scope of the pipeline and use human perception to assist with certain stages that are easy for humans to perform, but very difficult for computer algorithms.

In this workflow, there are no critical time constraints, and the data may not be as clean as would be the case if we had cooperation with the district. AuditEngine was originally designed with this workflow in mind, and with incomplete data, such as no CVR and no ballot style masters. We can conceptualize the following phases:</p> <ul> <li>Phase 1: Organize and reconcile the metadata from all sources including information about all the images and the CVR. The contests and option names can be derived from the CVR since we have it. This phase also includes a full examination of all images to read the style from each one so we can understand the style methodology being used.

For that performance, the \"mapping\" of the location of each markable oval on the ballot to what it means must be accomplished prior to receiving the ballot images. Also, it is required in this workflow, that the evalulation of the results by AuditEngine must be completed prior to receiving the CVR. Thus, there are three phase to this workflow:</p> <ul> <li>Phase 1: We require a source of data that will provide the contests and options exactly as used in the CVR. This can be from the Logic and Accuracy Test (\"LAT\") files. AuditEngine can perform automated mapping using the Ballot Style Masters and limited human-perception assistance by editing a spreadsheet. This produces redline proofs and option proof reports that can be reviewed to confirm the accuracy of the map.</li> <li>Phase 2: Just after the election, we receive the images. First, we must organize and checking them for repeated images and whether the number of images reconciles with the total number of ballots cast. The images are fully examined to extract the styles, which should match the styles mapped in Phase 1. There is another human-perception task to match the names used on BMD ballots to what is actually printed on those ballots. Next, the vote is fully extracted from the images to create the independent evaluation by AuditEngine, and provide that to the election staff.</li> <li>Phase 3: Receive the CVR and compare with the result of AuditEngine. Adjudicate as needed to finalize the result. This can be in concert with the election district where they may provide an initial CVR and then later, one that is adjusted to be more accurate.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"user-guide/auditengine_faqs/#q-what-are-the-auditengine-apps","title":"Q: What are the \"AuditEngine Apps\"?","text":"<p>AuditEngine has a number of browser-based apps that assist the user to conduct the audits.

However, we have recently completed a very thorough case study of the platform on three counties in Florida: Collier, Volusia, and St. Lucie. This case study provides evidence of the very high accuracy of AuditEngine, where it agrees with the voting system more than 99.7% of the ballots, and when we disagree with the voting system, AuditEngine interpreted voter intent 93% of the time correctly. In other words, we have proven that AuditEngine is more accurate in terms of automatically correctly interpreting voter intent than the voting systems. </p> <p>In the case study of Volusia County, FL in the 2020 General election, we identified a number of discrepancies in how results were uploaded to the Election Management System (EMS). As a result, we now know that there are two internal tabulations in ES&amp;S Equipment, and these two tabulation may grow to differ due to several error modes.</p> <p>We identified 4,904 ballot images that were duplicated, due to a failure of the thumbdrive in an early voting precinct and then \"clearing\" the election and starting over. But the images were not properly deleted and neither were the CVR records of those initial ballots. One voting machine that was never correctly uploaded using the thumbdrive, resulting in 537 fewer ballot images than should have been provided. Despite these operational errors, the tabulation from the county appeared correct, because it was based on the aggregated totals rather than the CVR and ballot images, which differed, but were internally consistent. </p> <p>These issues were detected not when the ballots were evaluated by AuditEngine, but rather during the metadata analysis phase.</p> <p>We have also recently audited Bartow County, GA, which uses Dominion Voting Systems equipment and software. Also, during the development of the platform, we performed audits of elections in Dane County, WI, Wakulla County, FL, Leon County FL and San Francisco, CA.</p> <p>You can read the case study report of three counties in FL and associated explanation videos on this page: https://copswiki.org/Common/M1970.

We turn a black box into a transparent box. </p> <p>The AuditEngine auditing system is simple in concept. We read the vote off each and every ballot image, and create an independent tabulation. Our system provides complete transparency, so you can take any ballot and follow it through the system. The system will find \"disagreements\", where the audit system interpreted the marks on the ballot differently from the voting system used by the jurisdiction. We will be able to manually inspect those ballot images and confirm how those ballots should be interpreted, and if we want, dig into the paper ballots and find those exact ballots. When we disagree with the voting system, AuditEngine correctly interprets the marks about 93% of the time, according to our recent case study in Florida, whereas the voting system interprets the same marks only 7% of the time. Typically, the disagreements are fewer than 0.25%, a quarter of one percent, depending on whether the voting system results were heavily manually adjudicated. Audit Engine tends to find incorrectly interpreted undervotes, where the voter made a mark that was intended for the candidate but was not sufficiently in the bubble. AuditEngine uses an \"adaptive threshold\" method which evaluates the marks based on other marks on the same ballot and the relative darkness or lightness of the ballot itself.</p>"},{"location":"user-guide/auditengine_faqs/#q-how-do-we-know-the-ballot-images-have-not-been-altered","title":"Q: How do we know the ballot images have not been altered?","text":"<ol> <li>The proper ballot images from the election department, as exported by the \"Election Management System\" or EMS must be uploaded to the secure cloud data center used by AuditEngine. After being uploaded, the hash values are easily read in the listing of each file without any further processing. These hash values can be compared with the values produces with similar calculations by election officials to confirm that the image files are the same. The use of these secure hashes is commonplace and a well respected methodology. <p>The following references provide an overview of hash functions and their use in the Federal Rules of Evidence:<ul> <li>\"Why Hash Values Are Crucial in Evidence Collection &amp; Digital Forensics\" -- https://blog.pagefreezer.com/importance-hash-values-evidence-collection-digital-forensics</li> <li>Federal Rules of Evidence FRE 902(13) and (14) -- https://www.foley.com/en/insights/publications/2017/12/new-federal-rules-of-evidence-90213-and-90214 </li> </ul> <li>The second level of this question has to do with whether a hacker has modified the images before they were captured by the election department, perhaps using a virus inside the voting machine itself. This may indeed be a hazard in the future when ballot image audits become commonplace. But in recent elections, no one expected a ballot image audit to be performed, and so if you assume a hacker or compromised insider wanted to modify the election, they would likely just modify the numbers in the election result (in the EMS database) rather than go to all the trouble of modifying the images, which is indeed a lot of work and may be obvious when the images are inspected. So for now, we can largely ignore the possibility that anyone would go to this expense.<ul> <li>If the ballot image audit finds no inconsistencies, one option is to perform an independent rescan of the ballots using high-speed scanners that are not used in the election process, process those images using AuditEngine, and then compare the result of the tabulation on those batches. This process would detect any image manipulation that would alter the result of any contest.</li> <li>Furthermore, we at CitizensOversight are working to include cybersecurity measures to allow us to detect any modification of ballot images once they are produced. At this time, these measures have not been adopted in the standards nor incorporated by voting machines. We view such hacks at the time the image is created to be very unlikely, particularly if the image is scanned using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) scanners that are not purpose-designed as a voting system.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Even while knowing that modification of the images is very unlikely, we do advise that some paper ballots also be inspected and compared with the images to provide further confidence. Today, most districts perform a limited audit of the paper ballots. That audit also verifies the ballot images, because the images are used by the tabulators to determine the vote on each ballot. We also suggest that if AuditEngine finds batches that have disagreements in terms of voter intent, the paper ballots can be checked by locating the paper ballot and inspecing and compariing it with the ballot image. Doing this a few times provides a good sense that the ballots are indeed well organized and there is a correspondence with the ballot images.</li> <li>If a thorough hand count is performed, checking the result of that hand count on a batch-by-batch basis can help to eliminate the possibility that: 1) the hand count was incorrectly performed, 2) the hand count results were modified, and 3) the ballot images were modified (of course to the extent any hand count reviewed those ballots.) Thus if a hand count covered only one or two contests, then those contests can be compared with the results of the ballot image audit (which covers all contests.)  In theory, image manipulation could occur in just those contests not hand counted, but modification of down ballot contests by modifying the images is even less likely.</li> <li>What we tend to find quite often is that there are inconsistencies in the ballot images in terms of the raw counts of images, if 1) some ballot images were copied twice into the set, 2) some ballots are rescanned to produce duplicate ballot images, or 3) some ballot images are missing when they are not uploaded to the EMS.

However, we can generate the target maps much more easily if we have them, and with fewer human error mistakes.  AuditEngine derives style masters from the images themselves, so it is not necessary to have all the ballot masters for each style. The helper app \"TargetMapper\" is then used to map the targets on the ballot to each style, contest and ballot option. If we can get the Ballot Style Masters, which are PDF files in \"searchable\" format, we can more easily extract the exact locations of each one of the target ovals and the associated text on the ballot.

BMD ballots are those printed by systems that incorporate touch screens to allow the voter to make selections, followed by printing a voted selection summary card. This card, or sheet, includes linear or 2-D barcodes that provide a machine-readable representation of the selections by the voter. These barcodes typically are difficult if not impossible for voters to verify, and instead voters can only verify their selections in printed text. Thus, the part verified by the voter is not read by voting systems. AuditEngine stands alone in the field of ballot image auditing offerings because we perform OCR on the printed selections to determine the vote on the ballot rather than relying on the barcodes. Because we compare that result with the official result in the Cast Vote Record, this essentially puts a check on the possibility that the barcodes might say one thing while the text says something else.</p>"},{"location":"user-guide/auditengine_faqs/#q-what-voting-systems-do-you-support","title":"Q: What voting systems do you support?","text":"<p>Currently, we support the two leading voting system vendors, Election Systems &amp; Software (ES&amp;S) and Dominion Voting Systems, and we are working to also support Hart Intercivic.

Open Source software works best when the users of those software modules are programmers who can then actively work to improve them. The users of AuditEngine are not programmers, and so providing open source software would not help verify the accuracy of the audit result.

This is the default mode of operation when AuditEngine is run by civic groups, candidates or campaigns without much interaction with election staff. This workflow is typically run after Certification and is dependent on the availability of ballot images and CVR files, which may be delayed until after certification. Because they are run after certification, audits using this workflow may still impact elections if there are significant findings in local contests but there is typically not a direct route to changing the outcome. But more importantly, they allow the campaigns to have all their questions answered and accept the outcome. This is particularly important for those candidates and their supporters who did not win. This workflow also requires the least amount of data as the Logic and Accuracy Test (LAT) ballot images nor the LAT CVR files are required, because the turnaround time is not optimized. However, there are two variants based on whether state law allows full public release of the data, as follows: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Public Oversight with Full Data Release    Ballot images and CVR files are all available and the election district provides these. We don't believe that any redaction of additional marks is required on these ballots, because largely, we will only need to view a subset of the ballots in our reports, and it is generally not possible to link the voter to their ballot. </p> </li> <li> <p>Public Oversight Workflow with Limited NDA    If state law does not embrace full release of ballot images, then we can accept those under a Limited Non-Disclosure Agreement (Limited NDA). We would keep the source data on a secure server and when reports are produced, only provide those ballot images that are at issue. </p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Cooperative Workflow   When audits are run in cooperation with election districts, turnaround time of results prior to Certification can be reduced by configuring AuditEngine prior to the start of the election using:</p> <ul> <li>Ballot Contest Names and Ballot Option names: We need a source of information for the exact text used on hand-marked paper ballots for contest names and option names. This could from the Logic and Accuracy Test (LAT) ballot images or an export of contest and option names from the voting system.</li> <li>CVR Contest Names and CVR Option Names: We need a source of information of the contest names and option names as used in the CVR.

Setup and Upload Data, Perform Consistency Checks: Create the Election and an Audit Job on our website and upload ballot images, cast vote records, and PDF ballot style masters, and any aggregated reports that are available. Create a Election Information File (EIF) which provides the official names of the contests and options. This is normally determined by the CVR and then edited by hand for the exact strings used on BMD ballots. The components of this phase became more involved than we expected due to variations of the data provided, particularly when there are repeated ballot images, differences between the CVR and ballot images, and the like. The result of this phase can be an invaluable check that the data matches other aspects of the election, such as the official number of ballots cast.</p> <p>Stages in this Phase:</p> <ul> <li>precheck - simply list all the input files associated with the audit.</li> <li>gen_biabif - review all the images files and extract metadata, including filenames, sizes, and any election metadata such as precinct, groups, etc. that may be encoded in the pathnames. The \"BIF\" is the ballot information established as a set of CSV (character separated values) tables. Any records where duplicate ballot_ids are located are segregated out in another residue table.</li> <li>cvr_to_eif - if the CVR is available, then the EIF (Election Information File) can be generated directly from the CVR data. This produces the DRAFT_EIF. This may need to be amended by hand to include the exact strings used on BMD ballots or the number of write-ins if that is not directly provided.</li> <li>parse_eif - After any changes have been made, then it is parsed and incorparated as the constests_dod.json file.</li> <li>preparse_cvr - for ES&amp;S, the CVR is provided in .xlsx format with some issues regarding column names and embedded images. These are preparsed to create simpler and easier to handle CSV format files. For Dominion, this stage is not needed.</li> <li>gen_cvrbif - Create the cvr_bif, which is the metadata from the CVR, for each record in the CVR. Please note, the cvr_bif records are in a different order from the bia_bif. Again, these tables are in CSV format.</li> <li>combine_bifs - This stage essentially performs a full outer join of the biabif and cvrbif to create the biacvr_bif. This contains all the records that are in the BIAs amended with metadata from the cvrbif.</li> <li>gen_fullbif - This stage is not always required and cost saving can result if we have full style information for each record in the CVR. If not, this stage essentially generates that style information. If we are unsure the how the style information in the CVR relates to the style information from the ballot images, it is necessary. It involves a fairly expensive ballot image evaluation of all hand-marked (nonBMD) ballot images to extracts only the style indication. This stage does not process BMD ballots. As a result, the full_bif is created, which now includes the metadata extracted from the images for nonBMD ballots. This stage is parallel processed in the cloud with up to 10,000 computers and usually 100 images processed each.</li> <li>create_bif_report - At this point, the BIF report is generated which provides a summary of all the metadata and provides a chance to check the consistency of the data between the CVR, BIA listing and ballot images, and to help determine how ballot style information will be handled.</li> </ul> <p>2. Create Style Templates and Map the Styles: Ballot image data is processed to create style templates based on the style strategy determined by reviewing the bif_report. Style templates are generated from the ballot image data itself, by combining up to 50 base images to clarify and improve the fidelity of the templates. </p> <p>Note: To be able to expedite turn-around during elections when AuditEngine is used in cooperation with election districts, this phase is completed in an audit using the Logic and Accuracy Test (LAT) data, and then in the real election, AuditEngine can be configured to only use import_targetmap from the LAT audit job, and the subsequent stage will be extractvote. This eliminate the time consuming stage involving human-eye assistance to map the data.</p> <p>Stages in this phase:</p> <ul> <li>build_template_tasklists -- by reviewing the full_bif with style information determined, these are grouped to provide a list of 60 ballots which are candidates to combine, if at least 60 ballots are available. Otherwise, it lists as many as are available.</li> <li>gentemplates -- This stage combines the best up to 50 candidate ballots to form clarified and improved template images for each style. This is run in parallel, with one computer allocated to each style.</li> <li>gen_templates_report -- This stage creates a report of the operation of the gentemplates stage.</li> <li>gen_target_mapper_package -- After reviewing the quality of the templates, then the data is packaged up for use by the TargetMapper App.</li> <li>Run TargetMapper -- This is an AuditEngine app which provides a user-friendly and powerful interface to generate the target map. This can be a time consuming step, depending on the number of styles and the complexity of the election. For average elections, this can take about half a day, including checking the redline_proofs.</li> <li>import_targetmap -- the file 'targetmap.json' is imported and checked for consistency. If there are any mapping issues, then this will generate an error message to help the user locate the mis-mapping. If an error occurs, then the user Runs TargetMapper again, unlocks it to allow changes, and makes the corrections, then relocks it, and then this stage is run again until no errors remain.</li> <li>gen_all_redlined_proofs -- These images are derived from the templates and then red annotation is added to allow them to be checked. This stage simply creates the images.</li> <li>gen_styles_report -- This report provides a list of all the styles and provides the redline proof of that style to allow for quality assurance checks of the mapping.</li> </ul> <p>3. Vote Extraction: Process all images again, but this time including BMD ballots, and create an independent tabulation. The CVR is not used at all during this phase.</p> <p>Stages used in this phase:</p> <ul> <li>extractvote -- This stage uses the map which was imported in the prior phase and fully checked for consistency. It pulls the ballot images directly from the ZIP archives and extracts the votes from each ballot, including BMD and nonBMD ballots, and creates the 'marks' data file which provides the evaluation of every target or BMD ballot selection. AuditEngine does this step using parallel processing in chunks of usually 100 ballots per chunk in one computer, using up to 10,000 computers in parallel. It uses adaptive thresholding to convert the marks into votes, and uses a set of heuristics to make good guesses when there are hesitation marks or cross-outs. Performs OCR on all BMD ballots to \"read\" the text so the QR codes are not relied upon.</li> <li>gen_extractvote_delegation_report -- This report details the status of all delegations and CPU time used for each one.</li> </ul> <p>4. Comparison and reporting: The tabulation created by AuditEngine is then compared ballot-by-ballot with the official results and any variants and disagreements are categorized into more than 40 categories, followed by automated report generation.</p> <p>Stages used in this phase:</p> <ul> <li>cmpcvr -- short for \"compare CVR\". This processes the result of the extractvote stage by comparing the evaluation of each ballot with the official result. For Dominion, it also compares with the pre-adjudicated and post-adjudicated snapshots in the CVR.</li> <li>gen_cmpcvr_report -- the produces the full discrepancy reports, including pie charts and reports by precinct and by contest. Details the first (usually) 50 variants from the first 10 contests, the closest 10 contests, and the 10 most variant contests, as well as the 10 most variant precincts. This is a lengthy report that is best viewed on the web to be able to look at the details of each variant ballot.</li> <li>gen_source_audit report -- this compares the aggregated totals from the 'source' archives with the official results. The 'source' archives are the main ballot image archives.</li> <li>gen_final_report -- This generates a short report which provides links to the other reports.</li> <li>hard_lock_job -- This stage simply locks the job so it cannot be altered in the future. This is a sematic lock.</li> </ul> <p>Other Optional Stages:</p> <p>There are a number of optional stages that are sometimes used:</p> <ul> <li>gen_verify_bia_bif -- this stage processes verification images which are scanned using scanners that are not part of the voting system, to provide a check on the images to detect possible image manipulation.</li> <li>extract_verify -- this stage is like extractvote but it uses the verification image archives. The verification images use the same map which was generated for the 'source' (main) images.</li> <li>gen_verify_audit_report -- this compares the verification samples with the official results on an aggregated basis.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"user-guide/scanengine/","title":"ScanEngine App","text":"<p>State regulations frequently call for scanning some or all ballots using a scanner(s) independent from the primary voting system, and then evaluating these images using a Ballot Image Auditing (BIA) platform or a secondary voting system.

Restoring the original order is important because the style of the back relies on the front. The underlying problem is that the files are commonly added to the ZIP archives according to how they are listed rather than the order they were created. When looking at the zip file, we can't get them back in order without a lot of work if we don't plan ahead. If file names are created correctly, then we can simply sort the names to get them to the original order, and in fact, they probably will be added to the zip file correctly too.</p> <p>Please adhere to the following rules:</p> <ul> <li>Keep file names relatively short and meaningful. </li> <li>Any number fields should be fixed-length and long enough to avoid overflow and create a number with more characters. For example, you should not ever see a number roll from 999 to 1000. But 0999 to 1000 is okay.</li> <li>If there is more than one number field, the first number field must not be reused even if the second number field has different range numbers.</li> <li>Non-number fields should be simple and just a few characters. Do not use any special characters. Do not include any spaces. Non-numbers can be used to indicate the GROUP of the ballots, such as EV, ED, MIB, PROV, etc. This can be first. Then there can be a batch number and sequence number.</li> <li>Use underscore \"_\" to separate groups of characters or numbers.</li> <li>The file name should be usable without the file extension as the ballot_id, which must be unique across all ballots.</li> <li>If two images are created for each sheet, they should be numbered so the order can be restored when resorted using a lexical (default) sort. Try to keep the images in front-back order. This should be normal for any duplexing scanner. </li> <li>Make sure that all ballots are imaged with the same number of pages. If both sides are included, they must be included for all  ballots in the set. If only the front is included, a random back should not also be included. This makes it very hard to keep the fronts and backs together.</li> <li>It is okay to have prefixes indicating the archive, like D001, D002, the precinct, group, etc. Always use fixed-length fields if numbering is used. Make sure it will be easy to parse the name to extract any meaningful data.</li> </ul> <p>Examples:</p> <ul> <li>GOOD: </li> </ul> <p>EV1_00004_000001.png,  EV1_00004_000002.png,</p> <p>... EV1_00004_009678.png,  EV1_00005_000001.png,    etc.</p> <ul> <li>BAD: </li> </ul> <p>\"scans from john's laptop - precincts 1 - 14 - 001_002\"    ...    \"scans from john's laptop - precincts 1-14 - 2000_002\"   and then later   \"scans from johns laptop pcts 1-14 - 001_4653\"</p> <p>Notice unnecessary information, special characters, spaces, different lengths, varying spaces, reused ranges.</p> <p>How to recover from bad naming procedures:</p> <ol> <li>Analyze ranges of names that exist in the set of images and plan a simple file naming scheme. Check with staff at AuditEngine  if needed to make sure that your plan will work to allow resorting of the names from each archive to return them to the originally scanned order. Make sure names are unique among all folders.</li> <li>Use existing numbers (but padded to fixed length) when possible and make sure you record how you renamed the original names to the new names.</li> <li>Unzip the zip files into separate folders so they can be renamed. Make sure you make a backup of the data.</li> <li>Use existing tools like Bulk Rename Utility (BRU) (https://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/) to quickly rename them. </li> <li>re-ZIP the files using a tool like 7zip.org, but please use conventional ZIP format not 7z format.  With 7zip, you can look at the listing of files in each ZIP archive and click on \"offset\" to see the exact ordering within the archive. The ordering in the archive should be the correct order of scanning if names were chosen correctly, or at least within the major blocks of ballots with no intermixing.</li> <li>Each zip file should include no more than about 30K files, and limit to 10GB for convenience of handling and uploading.</li> <li>Upload to the same project and then reassign the archives in the job file.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"user-guide/scanengine/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>The ScanEngine App is specifically suited to scanning ballots using a COTS high-speed duplexing scanner to produce images that can be incorporated in various auditing workflows.
