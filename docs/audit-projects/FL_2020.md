# Audit Projects -- Florida (FL_2020)

- **Top Counties --** In Georgia, the top 20 counties out of 67 (29%) includes 80% of the electorate
- **Ballot Images --** Ballot images are generally available by Public Records Request and AuditEngine has been tested on many of them. Florida officially allows counties to utilize 3rd-party independent automated audits. Many counties systematically delete their ballot images, and this is current being reviewed in court cases.

- **Voting System --** Florida uses both ES&S and Dominion voting systems.

- **Official Audits --** Signed into law in 2007, [Florida's audit law](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?mode=ViewStatutes&SubMenu=1&App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=101.591&URL=0100-0199/0101/Sections/0101.591.html) is not binding on official results, does not lead to a full recount, and audits only one randomly-selected election contest, selected separately in each county. No contest with boundaries greater than a county-wide contest can be effectively audited. In 2013 the audit law was amended to provide, in addition to a manual audit, the option of an "automated independent audit".

  The manual audit "shall consist of a public manual tally of the votes cast in one randomly selected race that appears on the ballot." See[Fla. Stat. Ann. Â§101.591(2)(a)](http://law.justia.com/codes/florida/2016/title-ix/chapter-101/section-101.591/).The automated audit "shall consist of a public automated tally of the votes cast across every race that appears on the ballot." See[Fla. Stat. Ann. Â§101.591(2)(b)](http://law.justia.com/codes/florida/2016/title-ix/chapter-101/section-101.591/).

- **Poll Tapes --** We have also been able to access "digital poll tapes" which we can use in a "Poll Tapes Audit" and it has been helpful in tracking down issues there.

  (Note: The Number of voters shown below is not absolutely current, but still provides valid relative ranking.)
