Our legitimate interests do not automatically override your interests. We will not use your Personal Data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you, unless we have your consent or those activities are otherwise required or permitted to by law. You have the right to object to processing that is based on our legitimate interests. For more information on your rights, please see "[Your Rights](privacy.md#your-rights)" section above.

## Data Transfers

Citizens Oversight is based in the United States, and we use service providers (described above) based in the United States to operate our business and our relationship with you.

The United States may have data protection laws less stringent than or otherwise different from the laws in effect in the country in which you are located. Where we transfer your Personal Data out of the EEA we will take steps to ensure that your rights continue to be protected. We endeavor to apply suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your Personal Data and to use it only consistent with your relationship with us and the practices described in this Privacy Policy. We also enter into data processing agreements and model clauses with vendors as appropriate.

## Children’s On-Line Privacy Information

In general, the Media Properties and Services are not intended for use by children under the age of 13, or 16 where applicable. In cases where certain Media Properties or Services are intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or 16 where applicable), we will post appropriate notices and take steps as required by applicable law to safeguard children’s data. In addition, we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13 (or 16 where applicable) through form submissions on our Media Properties or Services, although certain third party sites that we link to may do so. These third-party sites have their own terms of use and privacy policies and we encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children to never provide information on our Media Properties without their permission.

 Involvement of parents: In accordance with the provisions of the Children’s Online Privacy Act, in the event that we do begin collecting any Personal Information or data from children under the age of 13 (or 16 where applicable), we will notify parents first, and will seek parental or guardian consent to collect, use and/or disclose certain Personal Information from children under the age of 13, or 16 where applicable. A parent may review and have deleted their child’s Personal Information, and may refuse to permit further collection or use of their child’s information by contacting us as noted at the end of this Privacy Policy. Parents may consent to our collection and use of their child’s Personal Information without consenting to the disclosure of that information to others.

If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 (or 16) has provided Personal Information "[Contact Us](https://cm.azcentral.com/privacy#otnotice-section-4b7267ae-594a-4dff-b734-da7fe351004f)" below with sufficient detail to enable us to delete that information from our databases.

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy for California Residents is provided by Citizens Oversight, Inc. and its affiliates ("Citizens Oversight" "we", "our" "us"). This Privacy Policy is applicable to the publications, businesses, websites and mobile applications operated by Citizens Oversight, including the Website or applications from which you accessed this Privacy Policy (our websites and mobile applications are collectively referred to as "Media Properties"). It also applies to the related online services that we provide through our Websites (the "Services").

This Privacy Policy applies solely to the Personal Information (as defined below in Section 1) collected from consumers or users who reside in the State of California ("users," "consumers" or "you"). The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("CCPA") requires certain notice(s) and may provide specific rights to California residents, which are detailed below.

By using the Media Property and/or the Services, and providing us with Personal Information you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy and the [Cookie Policy](https://cm.azcentral.com/cookie-policy) referenced below and to the updates to these policies posted here from time to time. To make sure you stay informed of all changes, you should check these policies periodically. Updates will be referenced by the "Last Updated" date shown above.

## Definition of Personal Data

For purposes of this Privacy Policy, except where a different definition is noted, "Personal Information" means information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer, household, or device.

Personal Information for purposes of this Privacy Policy does not include:

- Your name, phot and/or other information about you included in news or editorial content.
- Publicly available information from government records.
- De-identified or aggregated consumer information.

## California "Shine the Light" Law/Your California Privacy Rights

## CCPA Disclosures and Rights; Do Not Sell

**Personal Information We Collect**

The following is a list of categories of Personal Information which may have been collected from consumers or users of our Services within the last twelve (12) months. The categories and examples provided in the chart below are those defined in the CCPA. This does not mean that all examples of that category of Personal Information were in fact collected but reflects our good faith belief to the best of our knowledge that some of that information may have been collected about consumers. We will update this disclosure from time to time as appropriate.

| **Category**                                                 | **Examples**                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| A. Identifiers.                                              | A name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, Internet Protocol address, email address, account username, screen name, password, Social Security number, driver’s license number, passport number, or other similar identifiers. |

Code § 1798.80(e)). | A name, signature, Social Security number, physical characteristics or description, address, telephone number, passport number, driver’s license or state identification card number, insurance policy number, education, employment, employment history, bank account number, credit card number, debit card number, or any other financial information, medical information, or health insurance information. Some personal information included in this category may overlap with other categories. |
| C. Protected classification characteristics under California or federal law. | Age (40 years or older), race, color, ancestry, national origin, citizenship, religion or creed, marital status, medical condition, physical or mental disability, sex (including gender, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy or childbirth and related medical conditions), sexual orientation, veteran or military status. |
| D. Commercial information.                                   | Records of personal property, products or services purchased, obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies |
| F. Internet or other similar network activity.               | Browsing history, search history, information on a consumer’s interaction with a website, application, or advertisement, including user generated content. |

| H. Sensory data.                                             | Audio, electronic, visual, thermal, olfactory, or similar information. |
| I. Professional or employment-related information.           | Current or past job history or performance evaluations.      |
| J. Non-public education information (per the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (20 U.S.C. Section 1232g, 34 C.F.R. Part 99)). | Education records directly related to a student maintained by an educational institution or party acting on its behalf, such as grades, transcripts, class lists, student schedules, student identification codes, student financial information, or student disciplinary records. |
| K. Inferences drawn from other personal information.         | Profile reflecting a person’s preferences, characteristics, psychological trends, predispositions, behavior, attitudes, intelligence, abilities, and aptitudes. |

In response to a verified consumer request for categories of information collected, we will investigate and provide an individualized response to the consumer, and will not merely refer the consumer to our general practices outlined in this Privacy Policy unless our response would be the same for all consumers and this Privacy Policy discloses all the information that is otherwise required for the response to such a consumer request.

**Sources of Personal Information.**

- Directly from you. For example, during account registration from forms you complete, subscriptions you purchase or comments you provide on our Media Properties.
- Indirectly from you. For example, from observing your actions on our Media Properties.
- From third parties. For example, third party social networking providers and advertising companies, our affiliates and service providers who provide services or information to us. If you do not want us to collect information from social networks, you should review and adjust your privacy settings on those networks as desired before linking or connecting them to our Media Properties.
- From publicly available sources. For example, online database searches.

**Use and Disclosure ("Sale") of Personal Information**

The CCPA broadly defines the term "sale" to mean:

"Selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer’s personal information by the business to a third party for valuable consideration; or (B) sharing orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer’s personal information with a third party, whether for valuable consideration or for no consideration, for the third party’s commercial purposes."

Within this meaning, we may have disclosed (as that term is defined by the CCPA) Personal Information in the categories below from consumers and users of our Services within the last twelve months where such disclosure may fall within the CCPA’s definition of a "sale." When we disclose that we may have sold Personal Information, it means that we may have received some kind of benefit to our company in return for sharing Personal Information, it does not necessarily mean we received any money in exchange.

The categories below are those defined in the CCPA. This does not mean that all examples of that category of Personal Information were in fact "sold" but reflects our good faith belief to the best of our knowledge that some of that information may have been shared for value in return. We will update this disclosure from time to time as appropriate.

In response to a verified consumer request for categories of Personal Information "sold," we will investigate and provide an individualized response to the consumer, and will not merely refer the consumer to our general practices outlined in this Privacy Policy unless our response would be the same for all consumers and this Privacy Policy discloses all the information that is otherwise required for the response to such a consumer request.

Category

1. Identifiers.
2. Personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute.
3. Protected classification characteristics under California or federal law.
4. Commercial information.
5. Internet or other similar network activity.
6. Geolocation data.
7. Sensory data.
8. Professional or employment-related information.
9. Non-public education information.

If we decide to collect additional categories of Personal Information or use the Personal Information we collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes we will update this Privacy Policy.

In response to a verified consumer request to know what Personal Information was collected or sold, we will investigate and provide an individualized response to the consumer, which will include the business or commercial purpose for collecting and/or sharing that information. We will not merely refer the consumer to our general practices outlined in this Privacy Policy unless our response would be the same for all consumers and this Privacy Policy discloses all the information that is otherwise required for the response to such a consumer request.

**Disclosing Personal Information to Other Parties**

We may disclose your Personal Information to the following categories of other parties for a business purpose or commercial purpose, as those terms are defined in the CCPA:

**Your CCPA Privacy Rights and Choices**

California residents may have certain rights under the CCPA, many of which are subject to limitations or exceptions under applicable law:

(a) Right to Know about Personal Information Collected or "Sold"

You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your Personal Information over the past 12 months. After we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you within the time required by the CCPA, the relevant information, which may include:

- - - The categories of Personal Information we collected about you.
    - The categories of sources for the Personal Information we collected about you.
    - Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that Personal Information.
    - The categories of third parties with whom we share that Personal Information.
    - The specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).
    - If we sold your Personal Information, or disclosed your Personal Information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing:

1. 1. 1. sales, identifying the Personal Information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and
      2. disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the Personal Information categories that each category of recipient obtained.

(b) Right to Request Deletion of Personal Information

You have the right to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions, including if we need the Personal Information for a reason related to our business, such as:

1. 1. 1. providing goods or Services to you;
      2. detecting and resolving issues related to security or functionality;
      3. complying with legal obligations;
      4. conducting research in the public interest;
      5. exercising free speech or ensuring another’s exercise of free speech; or
      6. using the information for internal purposes that a consumer might reasonably expect.

After we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete your Personal Information from our records in the time and manner required by the CCPA, subject to any limitations or exceptions under law.

**Exercising Your Rights**

To exercise the rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us through the web form link provided below in [Contact Us.](https://cm.azcentral.com/privacy-policy#otnotice-section-bc511b5a-aa58-4b19-a51c-5083c6006eda)

You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.

The verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative. This means that in making a request you may be required to: provide your email and phone number, customer information, and/or account sign-up authentication or other information needed to verify your identity depending on the sensitivity of the Personal Information that is the subject of the request.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you. If we are unable to verify your identity, we reserve the right to deny the request. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.

If you choose to use an authorized agent to submit a request to know or a request to delete your information, we may require that you: (1) provide the authorized agent written permission to do so; and (2) verify your own identity directly with us. We will not require these steps if we have received proof that you have provided the authorized agent with a power of attorney pursuant to California Probate Code sections 4000 to 4465. We may deny a request from an agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf. We may also deny a request from an agent that does not meet the requirements for authorized agents under the CCPA.

Once we have verified your identity (and your authorized agent, as applicable), we will respond to your request as appropriate. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request. If we are unable to complete your request in whole or in part, we will let you know why.

**Response Timing and Format**

We use good faith efforts to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days after its receipt. If we need more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and the needed extension period in writing.

If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by email.

Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. If we cannot comply with any portion of a request, the response we provide will also explain why, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a commercially reasonable format to provide your Personal Information that is commonly useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, but we do not guarantee that all formats are useable in all media. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

**Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of CCPA Privacy Rights**

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. In particular, we will not:

- Deny you goods or services
- Charge you different prices for goods or services, whether through denying benefits or imposing penalties
- Provide you with a different level or quality of goods or services
- Threaten you with any of the above

**Financial Incentives**

We may offer you certain financial incentives for the collection of your Personal Information and as permitted by the CCPA. These incentives may result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your Personal Information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time. Details of the incentive, if applicable, including how to opt in or out and the basis for the value of the incentive, will be provided prior to or at the time of your participation.

**Do Not Sell My Personal Information.**

The CCPA requires businesses to provide a web page where consumers can opt out of the ''sale" of their Personal Information. California residents may exercise there "Do Not Sell" Right by clicking on the **Do Not Sell** button below.

## California Do Not Track Disclosures

We use commercially reasonable procedures and various technical, administrative and physical safeguards to help protect the confidentiality of Personal Information. However, no data transmitted over the Internet or stored or maintained by us or our third-party service providers can be 100% secure given the reality of communication via technology systems. Therefore, although we believe the measures implemented by us are commercially reasonable and reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved, we do not promise or guarantee, and you should not expect, that your Personal Information or private communications sent to us over those systems will always remain private or secure. We are not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security features.
