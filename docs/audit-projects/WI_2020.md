# Wisconsin 2020 (WI_2020)

- **Top Counties --** In Wisconsin, top 18 counties out of 72 (25%) includes 70% of the electorate.
- **Ballot Images --** Ballot images are generally available by Public Records Request and AuditEngine has been tested on several counties, including Dane County, one of the earliest to support the release of ballot images. 

- **Voting System --** Wisconsin uses ES&S, Dominion, and Clear Ballot (one county) voting systems.

- **Official Audits --** Passed in 2006, Wisconsin's audit legislation is not binding upon election results and cannot be expanded to a full recount. Audit law: http://law.justia.com/codes/wisconsin/2016/chapter-7/section-7.08/ 
  No mention is made of early, absentee, or provisional ballots in the statute governing audits or in the audit procedures outlined by the Election Commission. Wis. Stat. Ann. §7.08(6) requires only that electronic voting systems in each reporting unit be audited.
  Only general elections are audited. See Wis. Stat. Ann. §7.08(6). "Four (4) contests shall be audited, including the top contest on the ballot (either gubernatorial or presidential). The other audited contests shall be selected randomly by the Election Commission staff from the other state contests that appear on the ballot." 

  Wisconsin audits reporting units, which can be a ward, a combination of wards or other districts by which votes are tallied. See VSAR, page 1, Definitions". "The Election Commission staff will randomly select one hundred (100) reporting units across Wisconsin which will be subject to municipal audit, including a minimum of five (5) reporting units for each voting system used in Wisconsin."
