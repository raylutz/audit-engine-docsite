# Sending Election Data to AuditEngine

Sending data to be used by AuditEngine is the same regardless of the vendor, and thus we have just one guide for this. Generally, the options are to 

1. Upload directly to AuditEngine, 
2. Post the files on your site or on a posting service, 
3. Write the data to removable media (AKA Thumbdrives or Flash drives) and deliver that to our office using a delivery service (like UPS, FedEx, or USPS) or, 
4. For extremely large data transfers, we can have a 5TB jump drive delivered to your office and it will be sent directly to cloud storage service provider and avoid lengthy uploading processes.
