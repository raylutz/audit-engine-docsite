# Exporting Guide

We have compiled step-by-step guides to export data for use by AuditEngine for each of the following vendors. These step-by-step guides will help election staff to export the data we need to perform our audits.

## Dominion Voting Systems Exporting Guide

**[Dominion Voting Systems -- Exporting Guide](dom_exporting_guide.md)**

## Election Systems & Software (ES&S) Exporting Guide

**[Election Systems & Software (ES&S) -- Exporting Guide](ess_exporting_guide.md)**

## Hart Intercivic Exporting Guide

## Sending Election Data to AuditEngine

Sending data to be used by AuditEngine is the same regardless of the vendor, and thus we have just one guide for this. Generally, the options are to 

1. Upload directly to AuditEngine, 
2. Post on your site or a posting service, 
3. Write the data to removable media (AKA Thumbdrives or Flash drives) and deliver that to our office using a delivery service (like UPS, FedEx, or USPS) or, 
4. For extremely large data transfers, we can have a 5TB jump drive delivered to your office and it will be sent directly to cloud storage service provider and avoid a possibily lengthy uploading process.

**Please see the detailed document below.**
